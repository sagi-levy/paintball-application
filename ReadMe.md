The website I built and which I submit is a website for creating activities in the field of paintball.
About me:
For the past two years I have been working as an instructor of the paintball game, every day I get to guide a large number of groups of all ages and of all types and I noticed that my boss does not have a website. Something that would have allowed him to see the upcoming activities as well as those that have already taken place, and of course edit them accordingly.

In this project I will present my skills in backend & fronted development through a project
that reflects what I learned working with Node.js and MongoDB, React.js and more..
Through this site, clients will be able to create bookings for activities, and if they pay,
the activities will be entered into the calendar. And in addition, it will be possible to register
and perform operations such as editing, deleting and more... operations that will be
protected both on the server side and on the client side.
Every such action goes through the server and is ultimately saved in the Mongo database.
Of course, in some operations the client will require the transfer of a token and only after a
verification process will he be able to proceed to the next intermediary.
To log in as an administrator you can use an account
Phone Number: 0555555558
Password 123456
An action that will allow you to edit all the activities of all clients.
In this project I worked with various libraries including
express,axios,mongoose,bcrypt,lodash,joi,jsonwebtoken,react-dom,bootstrap and so on.
Also, I work with branches and every time I add user stories to my site in order to improve
and learn.
To run the project you need to install all node module packages both on the backend and on the frontend
And through the terminal you need to write
npm start

Throughout the development process, I worked on several platforms in order to open a new user story for each feature, and from time to time I asked my uncle to do a CR which allowed me to do PR and resolve conflicts myself,as you can see in the following images.
Also at the beginning of the work process, I made a flow chart in order to understand the logic of the website I want to make.
