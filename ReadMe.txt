The website I built and which I submit is a website for creating activities in the field of paintball.
About me:
For the past two years I have been working as an instructor of the paintball game, every day I get to guide a large number of groups of all ages and of all types and I noticed that my boss does not have a website. Something that would have allowed him to see the upcoming activities as well as those that have already taken place, and of course edit them accordingly.
Through this site, my boss, hereinafter the manager, hereinafter admin
An admin will be able to register on the site and create tickets for future activities and those that have already taken place
The information will appear as a card, the administrator can edit and delete.
Every such action goes through the server and is ultimately saved in the Mongo database.
A non-user client will also be able to record activities in the log, but to edit or delete them, he will have to register.
Each user can only edit and delete their activities.
It is not possible to make a reservation for a date and time that is already occupied by another activity.
The user can change the password or if he has forgotten it, he can reset the password using a one-time code sent by email.
Attached is a link to the application via the render.com website

The application must be opened
(Only after you have done so
npm install - to install all node module packages both on the backend and on the frontend)
And through the terminal you have to tap
npm start in the backend folder
